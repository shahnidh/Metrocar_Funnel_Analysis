# Metrocar_Funnel_Analysis

## Objective:

The Funnel Analysis Project is designed to analyze and optimize the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app akin to Uber or Lyft. The primary goal is to identify areas within the customer journey that require improvement, enabling the company to enhance conversion rates, reduce drop-offs, and improve overall customer engagement. The analysis leverages SQL for data extraction and Pandas for in-depth data analysis and visualization.

## Project overview:

Metrocar, like other ride-sharing platforms, has a multi-step customer journey from the initial user interaction to the completion of a ride. This project aims to dissect each stage of this journey using funnel analysis techniques to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. The insights derived from this analysis will inform actionable recommendations to enhance user experience and increase overall platform efficiency.

By applying a combination of SQL, Pandas, and advanced visualization techniques, the project will provide Metrocar with clear, data-driven recommendations to improve their ride-sharing service.

## Key Tasks of Analysis:

**Funnel Analysis:** The central task is to conduct a comprehensive funnel analysis of Metrocarâ€™s customer journey. This involves:

**Identifying points of user drop-off:** Evaluating how different user segments (e.g., based on platform, age group) perform through the funnel. Understanding the patterns of ride requests and their timing, which may reveal opportunities for implementing surge pricing.

**Data Collection and Preparation:**

**SQL:** Used for querying and extracting relevant data from the Metrocar database. **Pandas:** Employed for cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing the data. This involves merging different tables, handling missing values, and preparing the data for visualization. **Visualization and Reporting:** The project involves creating visual representations of the funnel analysis results. Utilizing tools like Plotly enables the development of interactive visualizations, allowing stakeholders to explore the data dynamically.

## Key Findings Summary:

The funnel analysis of Metrocar revealed several key insights:

**Significant Drop-Offs:** The largest user drop-offs occur between app download and signup (25%) and from ride acceptance to ride completion (49%). Simplifying the signup process and enhancing driver availability could help mitigate these losses.

**Platform Performance:** iOS users show higher engagement, suggesting a need to prioritize budget allocation towards iOS platforms, particularly in the U.S., where higher income levels correlate with increased app revenue.

**Age Group Analysis:** The primary user demographic is aged 35-44, with a significant 53% drop-off at the upper funnel stage through all age groups, indicating the need for targeted strategies to improve retention.

**Surge Pricing Opportunities:** Peak ride requests occur during weekday mornings and evenings, suggesting opportunities for surge pricing during these times to maximize revenue.

**Negative User Sentiment:** Review analysis revealed overwhelmingly negative sentiments, particularly regarding driver professionalism and ride comfort, indicating a need for service quality improvements.
